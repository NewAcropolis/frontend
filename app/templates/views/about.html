{% set philosophyText =  """
Philosophy, in its original meaning, is the love of wisdom and the quest to understand the underlying principles of life. In this sense, we are all philosophers. We all have questions and we all have the intuition that there are answers to be found.<br><br>
Every civilization has passed on to us its knowledge and experience of the essential laws of life. A systematic and comparative study of this vast heritage enables us to discover the universal and timeless ideas that have formed characters, shaped visions of the future and helped men and women to meet the challenges of their time. As a School of Philosophy in the Classical Tradition, we offer a wide-ranging programme of studies designed to provide a holistic education - an education that does not just impart knowledge but also awakens and develops our other human faculties such as love, compassion, imagination, intuition, will power, perseverance, and any others that can help us to overcome our individual and collective problems.<br><br>
A philosophical education may not lead to the quick, veriÔ¨Åable and measurable products we are so accustomed to expect. But it can produce a profound transformation within the individual, and therein lies its value.

            <p class="card-text">The many facets of Jorge Angel Livraga Rizzi can be seen reflected in his life's work: International Organisation New Acropolis, which is present today in over 60 countries. </p>
            <p class="card-text">His approach consisted in proposing a revival of the idea of a School of Philosophy in the classical tradition and reintroducing the Socratic method as the human being's search for wisdom and knowledge. In antiquity, these schools - such as Plato's Academy, Aristotle's Lyceum or the Neoplatonic School of Alexandria - helped to inject new vitality and to give new direction to the societies of their times. This need for renewal re-emerged in the middle of the 20th century, with deep roots in the classical tradition and forward looking vision towards the 3rd millennium</p>

            <p class="card-text">As the current president of International Organisation New Acropolis, Delia Steinberg Guzm√•n has continued and developed the legacy of its founder Jorge Angel Livraga (1931-1991). </p>
            <p class="card-text">Combining her musical background as a former concert pianist with an eclectic range of university studies in humanities and sciences, she has consistently focused her energies on the cultivation of philosophy as a way of life.
            Guided by the idea that the best form of teaching is by example, she has concentrated on passing her practical understanding of philosophy in the classical tradition through classes and lectures and through her humerous writings. 
              Her most recent works in the field of practical philosophy are <i>The Everday Hero</i> and <i>Philosophy for Living</i>.</p>
            <p class="card-text"> Although she left behind her musical career to devote herself to philosophy, she has continued to promote the musical arts as a part of the cultural offering of New Acropolis, founding the <i>Tristan Institute for Music and Arts Education</i>,
              and the <i>Delia Steinberg International Piano Competition</i>, which is aimed at fostering young musical talent.</p>
            <p class="card-text"> In reality, she has always seen a close link between music and philosophy, for as the Roman philosopher Plotinus famously wrote: "Philosophy is a music made by the soul in the silent dimension of the invisible." READ MORE</p>
