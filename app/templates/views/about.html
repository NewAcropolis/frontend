PHILOSOPHY<br><br>
Philosophy, in its original meaning, is the love of wisdom and the quest to understand the underlying principles of life. In this sense, we are all philosophers. We all have questions and we all have the intuition that there are answers to be found.<br><br>
Every civilization has passed on to us its knowledge and experience of the essential laws of life. A systematic and comparative study of this vast heritage enables us to discover the universal and timeless ideas that have formed characters, shaped visions of the future and helped men and women to meet the challenges of their time.<br><br>
As a School of Philosophy in the Classical Tradition, we offer a wide-ranging programme of studies designed to provide a holistic education - an education that does not just impart knowledge but also awakens and develops our other human faculties such as love, compassion, imagination, intuition, will power, perseverance, and any others that can help us to overcome our individual and collective problems.<br><br>
A philosophical education may not lead to the quick, verifiable and measurable products we are so accustomed to expect. But it can produce a profound transformation within the individual, and therein lies its value.

VOLUNTEERING<br><br>
Philosophy also has a practical aim: to provide human beings with valid tools to meet the individual and collective challenges of today and to create a better world for the next generation. Volunteering forms part of our philosophical training and we actively encourage people to take up their civic responsibility and to become involved in a community project.<br><br>
We all want to be useful and be able to help. Our training programmes for volunteers aim to equip individuals with the necessary skills and know-how to play an active role in society and to prepare them for emergency situations.<br><br>
Our own volunteering projects include helping with the planting and maintenance in Compton Terrace Gardens and looking after two hives in our Melissa Bee Sanctuary. Our school of philosophy itself offers many opportunities as it is run entirely by volunteers. We also promote the idea of working together with other associations and individuals for the benefit of society.<br><br>
Our belief is that we need to cultivate human resources in our society so that we can resolve the problems we are currently racing and prepare a better society for the next generation.

{% set cultureText = """
CULTURE<br><br>
What is first: the human being or culture? This is a chicken and egg question and it is clear that the human being is a product of its culture and that culture is a product of the human being. Culture is education in the widest sense of the word. It is only through culture that human beings can unfold their human-ness. Through the education provided by culture we learn in a few years of our lives what it took humanity thousands of years to learn. In this way, culture has the power to accelerate our evolution.<br><br>
It is often said that the purpose of education is to ‘draw out’ (Latin: educare) the inner potential. Without culture and education we could not develop this potential.<br><br>
Culture transmits values and provides us with forms through which we can express these values. Cultural traditions and celebrations enable us to transcend the secular and enter into contact with the sacred. Many traditions also remind us of the annual cycle of nature and help us to re-connect with nature in a profound way.<br>
In New Acropolis we explore various arts, crafts and traditions, visit sites of cultural and historical interest in Britain and abroad, and try to bring people into closer contact with nature.

            <p class="card-text">The many facets of Jorge Angel Livraga Rizzi can be seen reflected in his life's work: International Organisation New Acropolis, which is present today in over 60 countries. </p>
            <p class="card-text">His approach consisted in proposing a revival of the idea of a School of Philosophy in the classical tradition and reintroducing the Socratic method as the human being's search for wisdom and knowledge. In antiquity, these schools - such as Plato's Academy, Aristotle's Lyceum or the Neoplatonic School of Alexandria - helped to inject new vitality and to give new direction to the societies of their times. This need for renewal re-emerged in the middle of the 20th century, with deep roots in the classical tradition and forward looking vision towards the 3rd millennium</p>

            <p class="card-text">Combining her musical background as a former concert pianist with an eclectic range of university studies in humanities and sciences, she has consistently focused her energies on the cultivation of philosophy as a way of life.
            Guided by the idea that the best form of teaching is by example, she has concentrated on passing her practical understanding of philosophy in the classical tradition through classes and lectures and through her humerous writings. 
              Her most recent works in the field of practical philosophy are <i>The Everday Hero</i> and <i>Philosophy for Living</i>.</p>
            <p class="card-text"> Although she left behind her musical career to devote herself to philosophy, she has continued to promote the musical arts as a part of the cultural offering of New Acropolis, founding the <i>Tristan Institute for Music and Arts Education</i>,
              and the <i>Delia Steinberg International Piano Competition</i>, which is aimed at fostering young musical talent.</p>
            <p class="card-text"> In reality, she has always seen a close link between music and philosophy, for as the Roman philosopher Plotinus famously wrote: "Philosophy is a music made by the soul in the silent dimension of the invisible." READ MORE</p>
