h2. Tibet

Tibet is well-known by its magical and metaphysical knowledge, shrouded in mist and mystery, the land beyond the Himalayas was inaccessible for hundreds of years. However, one of the few individuals who eventually gained access to Tibet and its schools was the great teacher Helena Petrovna Blavastsky or HPB, as she is often known. 
Following the education that she received in Tibet H.P.B. then dedicated herself to introducing the profound ideas she had received there to the Western world.
The book introduced by HPB ‘The Voice of the Silence’ provides us with a window into the spiritual thought and practices that once flourished in Tibet. 
In this part of the course we will look at selected passages from ‘The Voice of the Silence’, and will consider the importance of connecting with our own inner voice, the different stages that are encountered during the journey to wisdom and also how we can learn discernment between ‘the real’ and ‘the unreal’. We will also consider the importance of compassion and the need to develop concentration, an ability considered essential for students in the spiritual Tibetan schools.
