h2. Timeless & Universal Philosophy

Every civilisation has passed on to us its knowledge and experience of the essential laws of life. A systematic and comparative study of this vast heritage enables us to discover the universal and timeless ideas that have formed characters, shaped visions of the future and helped men and women to meet the challenges of their time. By studying essential, universal principles, we aim to understand and develop an own inner attitude to deal with conflicts in life. 

In this first part of the course we will consider the value of timeless and universal philosophy in relation to science, politics, religion and art. We will ask what ethics and morals are timeless and how do we find them today? We will also discover the idea of the seven principles in nature and how according to Eastern Philosophy, these seven principles exists within the human being. We will also look at the universal philosophical concept of the intelligible and phenomenal worlds.
