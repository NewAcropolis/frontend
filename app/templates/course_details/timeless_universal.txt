h2. Timeless & Universal Philosophy

Every civilisation has passed on to us its knowledge and experience of the essential laws of life. A systematic and comparative study of this vast heritage enables us to discover the universal and timeless ideas that have formed characters, shaped visions of the future and helped men and women to meet the challenges of their time. Understanding essential, universal principles can help us develop an inner attitude that will enable us to deal more successfully with life's unavoidable difficulties.

In this first evening of the course we will consider the value of a timeless or perennial philosophy and how it can illuminate science, politics, religion and art; and we will explore the difference between timeless ethics and practical morality.
