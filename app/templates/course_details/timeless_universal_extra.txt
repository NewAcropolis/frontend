h3. What is Practical Philosophy?

In antiquity, the practical aspect of philosophy was inevitable. To be a philosopher one needed to walk the talk. In most universities today, this practical side of philosophy is largely lost, however, if we consider the essence of philosophy contains a need to understand events, ourselves and experiences, then let us think, how can we truly know something that we cannot live and or cannot do? 
According to the American writer, historian and philosopher, Will Durant - a philosopher is not content to describe the facts but wishes to ascertain its relation to experience. Wisdom has a quality superior to and different from ordinary knowledge and by taking inspiration from the ancient philosophers we promote practical philosophy as a way of life, where we not only study the philosophical ideas but also learn how to live well.
