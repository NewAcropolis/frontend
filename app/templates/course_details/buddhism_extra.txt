h3. Life of Buddha

Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha, also known as Shakyamuni (sage of the Shakya clan) was born a prince and heir to a kingdom. From these beginnings, seemingly destined for a life of luxury and wealth, the young Siddhartha Gautama made a series of life-changing decisions which set him on course to become one of the greatest spiritual teachers, philosophers and sages that the world has known. It is generally thought that the key events of his life are a rich source of philosophical teachings in themselves, like an archetypal journey towards the 'middle path'. The name Buddha in Sanskrit literally means 'awakened one'.

h3. Why do we suffer?

The central doctrine of Buddhist teaching can be summarised as 'the elimination or cessation of suffering'. What the Buddha understood and explained so simply and timelessly with The Four Noble Truths was that everything in life is, in some way or another, suffering. Birth is suffering, death is suffering, even times of happiness, owing to their impermanence, will also bring about suffering. However, what the Buddha also understood was that there is a cause behind all of this suffering and that there is also a remedy âˆ’ a way to go beyond suffering.

h3. The Noble Eightfold Path

The last of The Four Noble Truths (leading to the elimination of suffering) is known as The Noble Eightfold Path. These eight simple steps gradually help to bring the individual life into alignment with Dharma and pave the way for spiritual development through effort, self-observation and correction. They are: Right Views, Right Aims, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Attention and Right Concentration.
