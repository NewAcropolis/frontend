h2. India

One of the great privileges of our modern times is that we are able to access a vast amount of knowledge of philosophies and ideas from different cultures, often stretching far back into history. The philosophies and traditions of India represent the backbone of much of the metaphysical knowledge which we have access to today. Ideas such as Karma, Dharma and Reincarnation also Yoga and the idea of the ‘inner battle’ are all essential attributes of the metaphysical thought that has its origins in India. In this part of the course you will be introduced to the Bhagavad-Gita which is the central text of the epic Sanskrit poem the Mahabharata and we will reflect upon themes such as the awakening of consciousness and the inner battle. You will also be introduced to the concepts of karma, dharma and reincarnation and in addition we will look at the different types of Yoga that existed in India and also the doctrine of ‘avatars’.
