h3. Confucius

Probably the most well-known of all ancient Chinese thinkers is Confucius, K’ung-fu-tzu (Master K’ung). Tradition says that he was born in 551BC in the state of Lu and that he was a descendant of the ancient royal house of Yin. There are traditional legends and folklore around his birth which often arise with special figures in history. Born during a time of conflict known as the ‘Warring States Period’ he stood out from an early age in his studies and in the pastimes that he enjoyed. As a young man he developed his reputation through good conduct and skill in public office and by the age of 25 he was widely known. If we were to describe the philosophy of Confucius in familiar terms, we could say that whilst his character was of the highest nobility, his approach is at the same time very ‘down to earth’.

h3. Junzi

The Junzi or Chün-tzu is the Confucian ideal of the ‘noble human being’ and for Confucius all the rulers and leaders in society should strive to become like the ‘Chün-tzu’. 
“A Chün-tzu cultivates his intelligence day and night to prepare himself to give the counsel sought from him. He cultivates integrity and honesty of character, being ready for the time when he has to govern.” 
The Junzi would make a conscious effort to develop their understanding of the highest ideals and virtues; they would work hard on developing their character and moral conduct in order to give these ideals their proper expression in life, and on being an example within their communities. 
“A Chün-tzu lives with the moderns, but studies the ancients. What he does today will become an example for the generations following him.”
