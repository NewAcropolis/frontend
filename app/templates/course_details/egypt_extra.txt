h3. Philosophy & Morality in Ancient Egypt

The ideal ancient Egyptian life was full of philosophical thought and moral action in all its different aspects, such as family, marriage, friendship, courtesy, work, religion and solidarity. In this part of the course, we will aim to bring the ancient moral and spiritual mindset of the Egyptians into view and consider how these attitudes contributed to this great flourishing of civilisation which has reverberated throughout history. 
“Do not separate your mind from your tongue, and all your plans will be successful.” (Maxims of Ani) 
“Do not be arrogant because of your knowledge, nor be quick to think of yourself as a learned man. Take counsel with the ignorant as well as the wise.” (The Wisdom of Ptahhotep)
